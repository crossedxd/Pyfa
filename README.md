The changes involved here integrate a function that closely mirrors the recently added "Optimize Fit Price" feature, but oriented towards making a given ship fitting as cheap as possible.

You can download this source and run "pyfa.py" to open the program.  The function "Cheapen Fit Price" is available both in the Edit dropdown menu, and in the options that appear when you export a fitting (copying it to clipboard).
